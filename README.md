Detection of human error caused in driving a four-wheeler vehicle to prevent accidents expeditiously. The idea behind the human error in driving is to detect the drowsiness of the driver by measuring the facial emotions over real time with the help of Computer Vision and Shape Predictor Model and alert the driver immediately. An alert message is send automatically by the system to the concerned ones if the driver persists in the non-stop dozing or yawning state in order to escape the mishap.The highest advantage of this system is to reduce the chance of human error by detecting it swiftly.
